      Simply put, **[Open source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)** is a term that refers to any type of device whose hardware specifications are fully documented or otherwise available.
      <br>
      <br>

      ## What are the main advantages of using open hardware?
      {.h3}

      First of all – it maximizes the ability of third-party programmers and partners to work with a given device. In most cases, hardware manufacturers provide only a basic level of programmability by releasing software development kits (SDKs) or limited documentation about hardware specifications. Sometimes additional hardware information is available through partner programs. But with open source hardware, all information is freely available to the public.

      If you wondered sometimes does your webcam is spying on you, or someone is listening in your microphone the main reason is that you’re not sure about all the possible features of these devices. That’s another big advantage of open hardware – you know exactly what the device is doing and how it works. If you understand it in a sufficient degree you can develop it, add features and customize it to infinity

      ## If it is Open Source, why are you selling it?
      {.h3}

      Open Hardware means that you are given all the instructions, schematics and BOM (Bill of Materials) and if you have all the parts, and have enough skill then you can build it by yourself.

      This is like a recipe. If you can cook it by yourself – fair enough. But keep in mind, that we are professional and dedicated chefs. Consider being our customer as visiting a good restaurant.

      In our **[shop](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop)** we offer some open source hardware products assembled by us or like **[RTE](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/product/rte/)** or **[TMP2 modules](https://shop.3mdeb.com/shop/product/tpm2/)** designed by us.

      ## What can we do?
      {.h3}

      Let’s imagine you have a business solution, an IoT device that will make life easier, and your wallet thicker. You know what you want, but you don’t have enough resources or knowledge to make it work. We have both. Prepare with our help a project charter that will describe your expectations, and we will create the device from scratch, develop firmware and integrate it with IoT. We’ll prepare all the documentation required to implement industrial manufacturing and maintain further development of your project.

      Sometimes you already have your product, but there are some modifications required. Maybe they will affect your firmware and make it obsolete. We can also help in this matter. It could happen, that you had to improve the security of your hardware. Yes, we also can do that.

          ## muxPi v1.4
          {.h3}

          **The highest density of interfaces per square meter for a decent price**

          MuxPi is an open hardware device consists of two main parts:

          * Main board
          * NanoPi NEO

          MuxPi might be considered as some kind of motherboard for NanoPi NEO SBC but it can operate without NanoPi NEO. However, in such a scenario its functionality is heavily reduced.

          The primary purpose of the muxPi board is to enable fully remote work with devices being tested, where hardware setup can be separated from the developer. The main advantage of this board is a large number of various interfaces, making muxPi very versatile testing board.

          MuxPi is equipped with many interfaces to interfere with the user and the Device Under Test: UART, USB, ETH, microSD card, dedicated Samsung USB interface, HDMI, LED display, push buttons and LEDs.

          ## OpenVizsla v3.2
          {.h3}

          **USB traffic catching has never been easier!**

          * Open hardware USB sniffer and analyzer in a decent prize
          * Provides streaming out a textual representation of USB traffic to stdout
          * Indispensable in debugging USB devices


          ##### OpenVizsla is an open hardware USB 2.0 sniffer and analyzer that provides user ability to see all the data flow between a host and target device.

          One of the useful application of OpenVizsla is a collection of bursty data that is possible by special buffer memory. It allows the capture and inspection of USB traffic and helps with the reverse engineering and debugging of proprietary USB devices. It also can be a valuable tool for developers working with USB and especially those who are using USB in embedded designs.

          **[Explore examples of using OpenVizsla by visiting our Blog](https://blog.3mdeb.com/2019/2019-04-24-usb-sniffing-with-openvizsla/)**

          ## OpenVizsla hardware is mainly composed <br /> of four chips connected together:
          {.h3}

          * **FTDI FT2232H High-Speed USB FIFO**
          * **Xilinx Spartan 6 LX FPGA**
          * **Micron MT48LC16M16A2P-xx SDRAM**
          * **SMSC USB3343 ULPI PHY**

          The FPGA packetizes the stream, and buffers it in SDRAM. The stream is then sent back to the analysis host via the FT2232H FIFO bridge.

          The Designers provides dedicated open-source firmware, that is easy to use and verified.

          {.h3}

          **Your little helper with Testing and Debugging**

          Tired of using many different peripherals and expensive hardware in testing and debugging Your devices? That’s all past!

          RTE is a hat designed for Orange Pi Zero board which runs specially crafted Linux distribution using the Yocto Project.

          We developed RTE to enable programmers from around the world at a low level firmware development without hassle of expensive and bloated remote Keyboard-Video-Mouse devices.

          In the result we have a tool which makes easier work with firmware debugging tasks. With RTE, your everyday work routines become much faster and easier to maintain from places not related to current setup location. Those include debugging tasks, flashing firmware, controlling GPIOs and power management for Device Under Test.

          ## TPM modules
          {.h3}

          > In anticipation of emerging trusted platform module (TPM) product capabilities, as well as requirements for device identification, authentication, encryption, measurement, and device integrity, DoD Components will ensure new computer assets (e.g., server, desktop, laptop, thin client, tablet, smartphone, personal digital assistant, mobile phone) procured to support DoD will include a TPM version 1.2 or higher where required by DISA STIGs and where such technology is available.

          US Department of Defence
          [**Instruction NUMBER 8500.01**](https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/J8THR9XYHNgrw4w)
          March 14, 2014

          **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor, a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.

          ## What is TPM for? Is it really necessary?

          Digital security is the computer equivalent of disaster insurance. Few people care very much about it or give it much thought, and everyone hates paying for it… until a catastrophe hits. Then we are either really glad we had it or really sad that we didn’t have enough of it or didn’t have it at all.

          The TPM was designed as one of the core building blocks for digital security solutions. The November 2013 **[“Report to the President: Immediate Opportunities for Strengthening the Nation’s Cybersecurity”](https://www.broadinstitute.org/files/sections/about/PCAST/2013%20pcast-cybersecurity.pdf)** recommends “the universal adoption of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), an industry-standard microchip designed to provide basic security-related functions, primarily involving encryption keys, including for phones and tablets.” Computers and devices that incorporate a TPM are able to create cryptographic keys and encrypt them so they can be decrypted only by the TPM.

          **Trusted Platform Module provides:**

          *   A random number generator
          *   Facilities for the secure generation of cryptographic keys for limited uses
          *   Remote attestation: Creates a nearly unforgeable hash key summary of the hardware and software configuration. The software in charge of hashing the configuration data determines the extent of the summary. This allows a third party to verify that the software has not been changed.
          *   Binding: Encrypts data using the TPM bind key, a unique RSA key descended from a storage key.
          *   Sealing: Similar to binding, but in addition, specifies the TPM state for the data to be decrypted (unsealed).
