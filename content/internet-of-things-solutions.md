      ## Smart space for business.
      {.h3}

      **IoT (Internet of Things)** - we create an intelligent space, we make objects and devices communicate with each other, collect, monitor and process data without human interference. We specialize in designing dashboards (control panels) for IoT networks. They allow for remote control of resources using computers or mobile devices. As a result, the business gains greater efficiency and space is easier to manage.

what_we_do:
  - title: "An example of what <br> we can exactly do:"
    content: |
      One of our clients was a company, which is dynamically growing in the IoT market. The project was focused on the gateway they produce. It was based on i.MX6 and have a lot of peripherals:

      *   **CAN**
      *   **Ethernet**
      *   **RS-485**
      *   **RS-232**
      *   **HDMI**
      *   **USB**
      *   **mPCIE**

  - title: "Our task was to prepare the whole system from scratch, by the way we’ve also done:"
    content: |
      *   Drivers and firmware for the end device (node),
      *   Gateway board bringup and BSP,
      *   Hardware-backed AWS Just in Time Registration (JITR),
      *   Gateway middleware application stack,
      *   REST API backend and integration with AWS IoT, AWS Lambda,
      *   Dashboard for data presentation

features_and_mission:
  - title: "Additional features"
    content: |
      *   Our engineers can help you to increase your device performance by optimization of firmware, and provide stability, that will make your device the one, you can really relay on.
      *   We’ll enable security features that will make the whole system a fortress, secured with cryptographic keys to ensure you, that your data won’t be changed or stolen. We have hands-on experience with Hardware Security Modules (such as TPM or Microchip ECC) integration and our security standards refer to US Department of Defence Instructions.
      *   Our Validation Team, which is a group of exceptionally experienced and gifted specialists, will make a full bunch of stress tests, that will verify the product in the most tricky boundary conditions.
      *   An over-the-air (OTA) update is a mechanism for remotely updating internet-connected hardware with new settings, software, and/or firmware. It’s incredibly important for such an update to be secure and verified. It may be unpleasant to be locked outside a rental property by bricked smart lock, but imagine a horror being a driver of a car that is remotely controlled by hackers. And yes, we can prepare IoT solutions that consist of secure OTA update for both the node and the gateway.
    
  - title: "Our mission"
