#### What 3mdeb **does for a living?**

We, the people of 3mdeb, are a team of dedicated engineers and developers,
familiar with almost every technology that is currently being used all over
the World. We‚Äôve mastered dozens of platforms and microchips, and have
significant experience in collaboration with companies from almost every
continent. We use all those advantages to create and support a sophisticated
embedded firmware for our clients‚Äô devices, for many purposes and with many
features. For all the applications we definitely prefer open source solutions.

#### Why should my firmware **be an Open Source?**

The term ‚Äúopen source‚Äù refers to something people can modify and share because
its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software with source
code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. We consider it much better
than ‚Äúclosed code‚Äù, because:

* We have more control over that kind of software. We can examine the code to
make sure it‚Äôs not doing anything we don‚Äôt want it to do, and we can change
parts of it we don‚Äôt like.
* We consider it more secure and stable than proprietary software.
Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot
and correct errors or omissions that a program‚Äôs original authors might have
missed.
* We claim, that public distribution of the source code for open source
software provide users that are relying on that software for critical
tasks an assurance that their tools won‚Äôt disappear or fall into disrepair
if their original creators stop working on them.

#### If it is open, why **should I pay for it?**

Because someone has to create it üôÇ Moreover, someone has to verify it works
properly, and all the features are on board. As our Client, you pay for our time
and knowledge. And if you are going to develop your device further,
we can accompany you in your travel.

#### Why should I choose 3mdeb **for development of my device firmware?**

We, the people of 3mdeb, are a team of dedicated engineers and developers,
familiar with almost every technology that is currently being used all over
the World. We‚Äôve mastered dozens of platforms and microchips, and have

#### Shouldn‚Äôt I‚Äôve rather order **this to a larger company?**

No, you shouldn‚Äôt. Large companies have a number of ready solutions, and they
will try to fit them into a solution of your problem. They are often strongly
attached to their policies and will try to persuade you to follow the path they
traced. This is not how we do that.

Moreover, in a large company every single section focuses on its tasks and its
well-known tools. Not rarely competing with other sections. We act as a team.
As one.

In 3mdeb we complement our abilities, learn from each other and in summary
have many more skills mastered, than any company section may have.

#### I know what I want my device to do, but it‚Äôs difficult for me to describe it

This is a common issue. For purposes of describing our goals, we use project
charters. This is a framework, which describes what our client essentially
want us to do. Creating a project charter may be challenging, but if there
is such a need we can help our Clients in creating one as a part of the
whole project. Contact us, describe your needs as precise as you can,
and we‚Äôll help you.

#### Why should I spend **about 200‚Ç¨ for a router?**

Because you don‚Äôt want someone to Hack your PC. Or encrypt your hard drive.
Or take your personal or business valuable data and sell it, or try to
blackmail you. Moreover, you probably may be interested in safely connecting
WWW via VPN, which takes a lot of memory and computing resources. Routers
are essentially computers. One of the most important roles of a modern router
is to provide security to its owner‚Äôs private or company network.
More powerful the device is more secure you are in case of brute force attack.
Good router insides contain good computer parts. With proper firewall software
it will become a security lock, protecting you from digital threads just as
enhanced door protects you, your family or your company from the physical
danger.
