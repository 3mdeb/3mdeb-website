    ## Operating Systems Development
    {.h3}

    At first, let’s explain something important. Most people after hearing `Operating System` will imagine Windows, iOS, maybe Android or some Linux distribution. Yes, all of them are Operating Systems, but **[3mdeb](https://3mdeb.com/)** focus on embedded solutions, which are able to operate with a limited number of resources, very compact and extremely efficient by design. These rarely have any **[GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)** and are designed to operate on small machines with less autonomy. That include devices used in IoT, robotics, healthcare, military, and in every field where systems are operation or life critical.

    ## What we do?
    {.h3}

    We develop and maintain Embedded Operating Systems for our partners. Simple as that. If you are looking for someone to create one from scratch, prepare **[BSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_support_package)** for your board which will control your device in the way described in a project charter, then you’ve found it.

    We will deliver you **[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/ecosystem/participants/)** or other Linux build system files that allow you to reproduce the BSP, which may contain i.e. root file system image, kernel, bootloader and anything that will be needed.

    Moreover, we will prepare a whole procedure and documentation for the process and validate it.

    For more examples of what we can do visit [**this page**.](/products/open-source-software/)
