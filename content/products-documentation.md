      ## RTE
      {.h3}

      **Remote testing environment** is a hat designed for Orange Pi Zero board which runs specially crafted Linux distribution using the Yocto Project.

      We developed **rte** to enable programmers from around the world in low level firmware development without hassle of heavy [KVM switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch) interface.

      In result we have tool which makes easier work with firmware debugging tasks.
