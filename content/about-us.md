   We are a small but worldwide-recognized embedded firmware development consultancy that leverages years of industry experience to provide innovative solutions. We help hardware OEMs and ODMs to achieve their full potential, security, and reliability of delivered products through Dasharo open-source firmware distributions. Dasharo combines coreboot, EDKII (UEFI reference implementation), LinuxBoot, U-Boot, and other open-source firmware projects to provide clean and simple code, long-term maintenance, transparent validation, privacy-respecting implementation, liberty for the owners, and trustworthiness for all.

   We support the medical industry using Verified Boot and Secure Boot technologies for Real-Time Operating Systems and Embedded Linux. Hyper-scale cloud providers get our firmware design and security skills to secure their computing infrastructure. Trusted Computing and Trusted Execution Environment applications are used and developed by us every day. There is no embedded software, firmware, or close-to hardware related challenge we would not consider.

   Our activity on high-profile professional conferences (Platform Security Summit, FOSDEM, Xen Developers Summit, and others), organization and co-organization of various events (Qubes OS mini-summit, GRUB2 mini-summit, LPC System Boot and Security Microconference) position us as a recognized community member and leader in evangelizing the use of open-source solutions.

   Over the years, the community recognized us as coreboot licensed service providers, UEFI Adopters, LVFS Consultants, and Yocto Participants and accepted our membership in OpenPOWER Foundation.

   Our team consists of passionate engineers and developers from open source software, firmware, and hardware communities, frequent conference speakers, and people who love to tinker with bits. Every day we develop bleeding-edge low-level security solutions using top open-source frameworks.

    - "I simply join the words of latter a here and a warm welcome Piotr. (â€¦) 3mdeb as licensed coreboot provider for PC Engines hardware this seems to take on a completely new quality. I am really impressed."
    - "Very rarely do I see such quality transparent collaboration and communication. (â€¦) Iâ€™d like to say thank you, Piotr, for supporting PC Engines. I absolutely love these little APU devices. Firmware work tends to be underappreciated, but itâ€™s hard work and I would like to thank you for your efforts."
    - "I continue to be impressed by 3mdeb's high-quality work on the PC Engines firmware (based on coreboot)! You can, with just a few commands, build a bit-for-bit equal firmware image on your own machine! Also they are responsive to GitHub issues and just got back to me to an almost-year old bug with a fix!"
    - "Please and thank you for the good job so far. Keep working please until all these requirements can be met. Look forward to hearing back"
    - "This company is a gem. If I had the resources, I would keep them all for our projects alone. Piotr and all his team at 3mdeb were simply won"
    - "I'm pleasantly surprised by the adequate and quick responses, thanks! And keep up the good work"
    - "Piotr and all his team at 3mdeb were simply wonderful, I couldnâ€™t find better."
    - "Fortunately, the pcengines coreboot maintainers are awesome people and interested in enabling cool use cases ðŸ™‚ I pointed them at this thread and briefly described the situation & motivation, and a MCFG table is now pending review! If you aren't afraid of reflashing, you may already be unblocked ðŸ™‚"

      The Yocto Project is a Linux Foundation collaborative open source project whose goal is to produce tools and processes that enable the creation of Linux distributions for embedded and IoT software that are independent of the underlying architecture of the embedded hardware. The project was announced by the Linux Foundation in 2010 and launched in March, 2011, in collaboration with 22 organizations, including OpenEmbedded.

      The Yocto Projectâ€™s focus is on improving the software development process for embedded Linux distributions. The Yocto Project provides interoperable tools, metadata, and processes that enable the rapid, repeatable development of Linux-based embedded systems in which every aspect of the development process can be customized.

      In October 2018, Arm Holdings partnered with Intel in order to share code for embedded systems through the Yocto Project.

      The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing legacy support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.

      Intel developed the original Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification. Some of the EFIâ€™s practices and data formats mirror those from Microsoft Windows. In 2005, UEFI deprecated EFI 1.10 (the final release of EFI). The Unified EFI Forum is the industry body that manages the UEFI specification.

      coreboot, formerly known as LinuxBIOS, is a software project aimed at replacing proprietary firmware (BIOS or UEFI) found in most computers with a lightweight firmware designed to perform only the minimum number of tasks necessary to load and run a modern 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.

      Since coreboot initializes the bare hardware, it must be ported to every chipset and motherboard that it supports. As a result, coreboot is available only for a limited number of hardware platforms and motherboard models.

      One of the coreboot variants is Libreboot, a variant of coreboot aiming to be fully free of proprietary blobs.

      The Linux Vendor Firmware Service is a secure portal that brings together firmware updates uploaded by renowned hardware vendors. The LVFS provides reliable firmware alongside with the detailed metadata for clients such as GNOME Software or fwupdmgr for controlling updates remotely through a terminal. There is no charge to vendors for the hosting or distribution of content and open source nature of this project provides additional value to the market with contributors from dozens of people from different companies. Consulting companies can offer advice on specific request implementation or help with custom plugins integration for fwupd allowing different protocols to be supported. We have experience in introducing new solutions (libflashrom API and fwupd flashrom plugin) into the current LVFS ecosystem and are not afraid to accept the most demanding firmware security challenges. We can become the maintainer of the firmware for your platform at any time!

      The OpenPOWER Foundation is a collaboration around Power ISA-based products initiated by IBM and announced as the "OpenPOWER Consortium" on August 6, 2013. IBM is opening up technology surrounding their Power Architecture offerings, such as processor specifications, firmware and software with a liberal license, and will be using a collaborative development model with their partners. The goal is to enable the server vendor ecosystem to build their own customized server, networking and storage hardware for future data centers and cloud computing. Power.org is still the governing body around the Power ISA instruction set but specific implementations are now free to use under a liberal license granted by IBM. Processors based on IBM's IP can now be fabricated on any foundry and mixed with other hardware products of the integrator's choice. On August 20, 2019, IBM announced that the OpenPOWER Foundation would become part of the Linux Foundation.
