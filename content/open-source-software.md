    But don’t be afraid, if there <strong>is some not listed above,</strong><br>
    we’ll surely confront any <strong>platform you will provide us.</strong><br>
    We can prepare a whole system <strong>from a scratch, make it secure,</strong><br>
    stable and last, but not least let it <strong>reach extraordinary performance.</strong>
