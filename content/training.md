  title: "Frequently asked **questions**"
  faqs:
    - title: "What does the Pace stand for?"
      content: |
        The Pace in the PET - Pace Enterprise Training is an accumulation of the following meanings:
        pace = 'pacing', e.g the lion paced back and forth
        pace = speed
        pace = pacing, synchronization with something else, e.g. open and closed information streams
        pace = customized pace of course for each customer/audience
        
        The meaning of PET can also be explained as Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

    - title: "Value proposition"
      content: |
        PET = OST + (theoretically) some proprietary additions which are not in upstream OST. Some could be upstreamed, some could be kept in OET (perhaps for years) based on unique student needs.

        Many of the security-related aspects of the Intel/AMD CPUs are confidential and require (C)NDA (Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement) to access documentation. What is more, it is not enough if both parties have necessary documents and agreements to discuss about them. To freely share information about these, more provisions (such as the MPNDA) are needed. Dasharo Silicon Vendor Onboarding is a Supplier’s product, which ensures an effective and standardized process for onboarding of the given business relationship with the Silicon Vendor, so all of the necessary information can be directly shared between the parties. In order to share the detailed results of the checks and propose a ways of improvements, it is necessary to proceed with the Dasharo Silicon Vendor Onboarding with each vendor participating in the certification program.
