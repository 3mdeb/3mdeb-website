  visions:
    - title: "OSFV **Team Vision**"
      content: |
        A powerful vision statement stays with you, such as Disney’s “to make people happy” or Instagram’s “capture and share the world’s moments.” But for many companies, vision statements are relegated to unassuming posters in the office lobby or staff lounge, forgotten even before they are hung up. OSFV vision should not only be meaningful to leverage the team engagement, but also throw light on its specifics for potential members. This document describes the purpose of creating open-source firmware Validation Team, its vision concluded with strategy and its members’ possible career development paths.

      intro: |
        We understand what **the software should do** <br>
        and have enough knowledge **to verify it does.**

      about_this_vision:
        - image: "images/careers/writing-notes-idea.jpg"
          title: "Introduction"
          content: |
            There is no value in passing all the tests. There is also none in failing all of them. And the validation, just like every other service, should be focused on bringing value. As the whole automated validation of embedded systems and firmware is still in its infancy we have a unique opportunity to influence its future shape. 3mdeb intends to be a leader in embedded validation, which means that we are going to create a special training department, promoting our vision of embedded validation and raising its level. What is more, our target is to build the open-source firmware Validation Framework, which is going to be a full application spreading from the cloud (virtualization, DevOps, etc.) to embedded systems (Yocto / Linux, Go, Python). This should be versatile, scalable and able to benchmark a wide range of IoT solutions `out of the box`. A parallel framework is going to be created for firmware (BIOS). Both are going to be consistent and interoperable with ATS (Automated Testing Summit) industrial standard and comparable to other frameworks.

          title: "Who **we need**"
          content: |
            We need people who understand why it is so important not to underestimate any, even the smallest defects arising from the tests during the development or maintenance process. What seems to be a minor and insignificant bug for a single device may produce a major issue for a thousand.

            #### What we provide
            {.fs-4 class="fw-semibold mb-3 mt-5"}

            * Hands-on the latest technologies and high-end solutions from firmware, embedded and IoT market.

          title: "Full **readiness**"
          content: |
            Getting familiar with processes, writing tests and our extensive testing infrastructure should take up to three months. However, taking into account the necessity to get acquainted with various projects depending on the actual needs may take a little longer.

    - title: "Firmware **Team Vision**"
      content: |

      intro: |
        If CPU is the heart of **the embedded system,** <br/>
        the firmware is **its spinal column.** <br/>
        Any serious malfunction of it **paralyzes the whole organism.** <br/>
        What we do is making firmware **as hard to break as possible.** <br/>

          title: "Introduction"
          content: |
            We are an independent BIOS vendor (IBV) providing open-source firmware solutions to its customers. The BIOS market is already mature and full of industry giants that provide firmware to most of the computers these days, but their solutions are mainly proprietary. 3mdeb would also like to be recognized on the market, thus we contribute to the projects such as coreboot, fwupd and many more. We are also UEFI Adopters and in the opposite to the biggest players, we are promoting its availability under the BSD 2-Clause and upstreaming source code that enables hardware of our clients to the community. We promote this approach, we prefer this approach, but all in all, we always respect our clients will. We want to prove that open solutions may also be valuable and what is the most important – secure. Creating secure firmware solutions with the best quality is one of the main Firmware Team’s tasks. Leveraging hardware security features and implementing its support (despite there is no known, fully operational open solution) is our everyday job.

          title: "Who **we need**"
          content: |
            We need people who are very familiar with computer architecture and understand C and assembly languages, the limitations of hardware, its behavior in various situations and electronics.

            #### What we provide
            {.fs-4 class="fw-semibold mb-3"}

            * Hands-on the latest technologies and high-end solutions.
            * Access to different projects with the possibility to learn a wide spectrum of modern technologies and broad own horizons.
            * Occasion to participate in open-source community and introduce some custom features in the source code.
            * Chance to visit many conferences and meet people from all over the world.

            #### What a good firmware engineer should be like:
            {.fs-4 class="fw-semibold mb-3 mt-5"}

            * enthusiastic about open-source – each engineer at 3mdeb should promote open-source as a part of own brand creation and company vision
            * scrupulous – even single bit change can cause a significant bug, even smallest changes in registers must not be ignored
            * self-reliant – firmware engineers at 3mdeb must be capable of finding the solution by themselves, a senior engineer may only guide to achieve a solution, but not point one
            * experienced with hardware – firmware flashing is done on a daily basis, knowledge from electronic engineering is required to avoid hardware damage during work
            * flexible and able to learn quickly – firmware prepares the environment for operating system launch, it is necessary to have knowledge about OS-firmware interactions, how to extract information, validate own work, etc.; without OS and its bootloader, the firmware is as good as useless, so often a firmware engineer work escalates to bootloaders, OSes and hypervisors
            * proficient with C and assembly – sometimes problems require deep dive into low-level code in order to locate the bug
            * patient and inquisitive – lots of firmware work is debugging while programming takes about 20% of the time; firmware engineer should be patient and inquisitive, because of the firmware complexity the problem may hypothetically lie in many components
            * willing to study – components that make a computer typically have their specification; almost every peripheral, interface, OS/firmware structures have their own specification (often hundreds of pages); firmware engineer must not be scared of the immensity of knowledge to be adopted in order to become a firmware expert
            * interested in technologies/projects like coreboot, UEFI, ACPI, Secure Boot, LinuxBoot, BMC, FPGA, EC, heads, tianocore, Linux kernel, GRUB, Xen, etc.

          title: "Full **readiness**"
          content: |
            Firmware topics are typically vast and the time required for full readiness may reach even years. The most important for a firmware engineer is self-improvement. Time spent on reading additional specifications and standards, getting to know new technologies and hardware pays off.

            For junior (or rather inexperienced candidate) it should take 3 to 6 months to achieve basic readiness to work as a firmware engineer at 3mdeb. While for regular engineer the time required is estimated to 1 month to be capable of working as a self-reliant person.

          content: |
            We develop and maintain Embedded Operating Systems for our partners. Simple as that. We focus on solutions, which are able to operate with a limited number of resources, very compact and extremely efficient by design. These rarely have any GUI and are designed to operate on small machines with less autonomy. That include devices used in IoT, robotics, healthcare, military, and in every field where systems are operation or life-critical. We often use Yocto meta layers to prepare OS’s that would fit the best in our customers’ needs.
