    At 3mdeb, we believe in the power of the open-source community. That's why we've created a program to provide financial support for your help in improving our projects, such as Dasharo and others. You can contribute to fixing bugs, adding new features, and even enhancing documentation.

    1. **Find a task:** Browse our repositories on GitHub, such as the ones available in the [Dasharo organization](https://github.com/orgs/Dasharo/repositories), and look for issues tagged with "bounty" and a category tag (e.g., "bounty-easy"). The category tag indicates the approximate financial support range you might receive.
    2. **Express your interest:** Let us know in the issue comments that you'd like to work on it.
    3. **Fork the repository:** Create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
    4. **Get assigned:* A maintainer will assign you to the task. To keep the task active, please provide regular updates on your progress.
    5. **Fix the problem/add the feature:** Develop your solution. Remember to follow the project's coding guidelines!
    7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Submit your changes by sending a PR to the original repository.
    8. **Wait for review:** Our team will review your code. We may ask you to make some adjustments.
    9. **Receive Financial Support!** If your PR is accepted and merged, you may receive financial support in recognition of your valuable contribution!

    **Important Note on Inactivity:**

    To ensure that bounty tasks are completed in a timely manner, if there is no meaningful update or code commit on your assigned task for one (1) month, you may be unassigned from the task. This allows others to take over and prevents tasks from becoming stalled. Please communicate regularly about your progress, even if it's just a small update.

    * **Diverse Contributions Welcome:** We highly value contributions across various domains that enhance our open-source projects. While code contributions (e.g., bug fixes, new features, scripts) are central, we also welcome valuable efforts in areas such as validation results, documentation, community management, marketing materials, SEO/web improvements, and event organization. If your contribution helps our projects grow, it might be eligible for financial support.
    * **Your work, your license:** You retain ownership of the code you write, but you agree to license it under an open-source license.
    * **Play nice:** Don't try to attack our systems and respect other users.
    * **Financial Support Processing:** Financial support is processed via our [3mdeb Open-Source Collective page on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/3mdeb_com). All payments are handled through this platform.
    * **Taxes:** Remember that you are responsible for paying any taxes in your country.
