### **Ordering and payment**

#### Q: Do you offer shipping to my country?

Yes, we offer worldwide shipping.

#### Q: What payment methods do you accept?

We accept: PayPal, Credit Card via Stripe, and Bank transfer.

### **Delivery**

#### Q: How can I track my order?

We will send you the tracking number on your email when your order is
prepared and ready for shipment.

#### Q: How long does order processing take?

Order Processing Time is individual for every product, you can check it on the
product page by clicking the "Additional information".

#### Q: Shipping cost?

Shipping costs are dependent on your address/country and products in your
shopping cart. The exact cost will be calculated upon checkout, based on the
provided shipping address.

#### Q: How do you ensure the safe shipping of the PC build?

Inspecting Your Shipment: Before the shipment of full PC builds we take pictures
of both the hardware and packaging. After it leaves our office we do not have
any control over it. It is the consignee’s responsibility to inspect their
shipment for damages before the Freight driver leaves the delivery location.
Should the packaging display any signs of damage, open it immediately to check
the contents, requesting the driver's presence to inspect together. If your
shipment has been damaged, document the damages on the delivery receipt in
detail and have it signed by the driver. If possible, please take pictures of
the damages to the box and the damages to the item. Please notify us immediately
so that we can initiate a damage claim with Freight. Failure to inspect for
damages at the time of delivery could result in Freight voiding any subsequent
damage claims.

### **Taxes & Import fees**

#### European Union

#### Q: Do the prices in the shop include VAT?

No, the prices listed in the shop are exclusive of VAT. A 23% VAT may be added
to the final price of your order, depending on the destination country of your
shipment.

#### Q: When can I use the 0% VAT option?

You can use the 0% VAT rate (reverse charge) if you're a business customer based
in another EU country (outside of Poland) and provide a valid EU VAT number. In
this case, your billing address must be registered to your company.

Please note that the 0% VAT rate does not apply to companies based in Poland —
for Polish businesses, the standard 23% VAT must still be added.

#### Q: If I order as a private person what VAT will I need to pay?

If you place an order as a private person, a 23% VAT will be added to your
order. This is because our company is based in Poland, and under EU regulations,
VAT is charged based on the seller's location, not the shipping country.
Therefore, even if your shipping address is in a different EU country, the
Polish VAT rate of 23% applies.

#### Outside of EU

#### Q: I live outside the European Union. Do I have to pay import taxes?

Yes, you may have to pay import taxes or customs fees when your order arrives in
your country. These charges are not included in the price you pay in our shop,
as they are determined by your country's customs and tax regulations. Each
country has its own rules, and duties, taxes, or administrative fees may apply.

The good news: If your delivery address is outside the EU, no VAT is charged at
checkout — you pay 0% VAT. This effectively means you're paying 23% less than
customers within the EU. However, please be aware that your local authorities
may still apply import duties or other charges upon delivery.
