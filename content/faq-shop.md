### **Delivery**

#### Q: How can I track my order?

prepared and ready for shipment.

#### Q: How long does order processing take?

Order Processing Time is individual for every product, you can check it on the
product page by clicking the "Additional information".

#### Q: Shipping cost?

Shipping costs are dependent on your address/country and products in your
shopping cart. The exact cost will be calculated upon checkout, based on the
provided shipping address.

#### Q: How do you ensure the safe shipping of the full PC build?

Inspecting Your Shipment: Before the shipment of full PC builds we take pictures
of both the hardware and packaging. After it leaves our office we do not have
any control over it. It is the consignee’s responsibility to inspect their
shipment for damages before the Freight driver leaves the delivery location.
Should the packaging display any signs of damage, open it immediately to check
the contents, requesting the driver's presence to inspect together. If your
shipment has been damaged, document the damages on the delivery receipt in
detail and have it signed by the driver. If possible, please take pictures of
the damages to the box and the damages to the item. Please notify us immediately
so that we can initiate a damage claim with Freight. Failure to inspect for
damages at the time of delivery could result in Freight voiding any subsequent
damage claims.
